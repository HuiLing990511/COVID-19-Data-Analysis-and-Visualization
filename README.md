# COVID-19-Data-Analysis-and-Visualization

## Background
The COVID-19 pandemic has brought unprecedented challenges to Malaysia, affecting the healthcare system, economy, and society at large. The vast amounts of data generated during the pandemic provide an opportunity to analyze the factors influencing case severity, vaccination effectiveness, and fatality rates. Understanding these factors is crucial for designing targeted health interventions and enabling informed policymaking. Despite significant vaccination efforts, questions remain about their effectiveness in reducing case severity and mortality rates. This project adopts a data-driven approach to uncover critical insights, optimize healthcare resource allocation, and improve future pandemic response readiness.

## Research Questions
1. What factors significantly influence COVID-19 outcomes in Malaysia?
2. Which demographics and regions are most vulnerable?
3. How do vaccination rates impact case severity and recovery rates?

## Business Objectives
1. Build predictive models to identify critical factors influencing COVID-19 outcomes.
2. Guide targeted health interventions and resource allocation.
3. Evaluate vaccination impacts on reducing case severity.
